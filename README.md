# Machine Learning Based Fracture Characterisation Using Phase Field Model
This project successfully developed a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model to 
predict displacement and damage evolution in a material under axial loading. The model 
effectively captured the relationship between applied load, displacement, and crack 
propagation, using the Phase-Field method and physics-informed loss functions to ensure 
physical consistency. The predictions for displacement and phase-field damage closely 
matched the true values from the simulation, offering a promising alternative to traditional 
methods like FEM for fracture mechanics problems.
